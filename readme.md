README

This program is designed to connect to the California Covid vaccinations data api, pull data into a json, and perform performance analytics on it.

Specifically, it is designed to filter this data down to specific demographics and dates in order to determine the effectiveness of Covid advertising campaigns by JP Marketing, to see if there is any noticeable change in the vaccination rates.

This analysis is correlation based and a broad overview way of determining if campaigns were successful, but in a situation in which beforehand the measurement for success was clicks on campaigns and nothing hard, correlation analysis is still an improvement.
